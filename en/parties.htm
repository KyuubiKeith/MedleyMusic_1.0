<p>The first Battle of The Bands took part in 2011 edition between Rhythm Junkies (as a home band) and Handsome Fred’s Orchestra (current Hornsgatan Ramblers). It was a rematch since they have battled one before in Stockholm, Sweden. The final verdict was 1:1.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Battles became a tradition of the festival and most of the time it is of a show and way of paying respects to the jazz culture, then a competition. Either way each time it is incredible.</p>

You can participate in the competition only as a couple. Make sure to come earlier to register at the entrance and pick up your number at least 30 min before it’s scheduled, since there a chance it could be earlier and also, later. There’s a one number per couple. It doesn’t matter if it’s a leader or follower wearing it until judges can see it.
	<br>If you still want to register for the competition, you can do it until 22:00 and only on Sunday at the entrance of the venue.&nbsp;</p>

                                                            <p>The format is called “The King of the Hill”. &nbsp;Finalists stand in line. The first in the line is the King of the hill and has to “defend” his position. The second dancer in line starts the battle. All finalists can dance as long as they want, but be noted, that most of the time, it’s not the length of the dance, that makes it better, so pace yourself since the competition could take a while. If the the spotlight is taking too long, the organizers &nbsp;will take responsibility to stop the music or pass the spotlight to the other dancer. After both dancers battle each other, the judges vote by pointing to one or the other dancer, or not voting at all, by saying both were equally good. The winner of the battle stays to defend his position and the loser goes back in the end of the line and waits for his next chance to become the “king of the hill”.
	<br>The winner is a dancer that collects the most wins of all finalists. If there is a tie the organisers can stop the competition and make the two finalist battle until “death”. &nbsp;May the best dancer be victorious!</p>

Prelims and semi-finals will take part around 20:30 and finals - around 23:30. If you are in the competition, make sure you’re there at 20:00 for prelims, and for finals at least 30 min before it’s scheduled, since there a chance it could be earlier and also, later.</p>

<p>Rules are easy. The prelims and semi-finals are the same as a regular J’n’J competition with different heats and partner changing. Number of heats will be decided according to the number of contestants. The Judges will have to see your number, so make sure you have it. Without your number you can’t participate. Semi-finals will take part right after the prelims. Judges will pick 12 leaders and 12 followers for semi-finals. If you get a sticker, you have to go register again and get a number for semi-finals.</p>

	<br>The Finals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Followers will pick a number of their leader and leader will pick a number of their spotlight. There will be a warm up song. Spotlights goes like this - the first song will be slow and all couples will do two spotlights each. During the first spotlight dancers can't touch, that means, they will dance solo, in front of each other, inspiring each other. Second spotlight is as a regular couple dance. Same idea with the fast song. That means during two songs each couple will have 4 spotlights (1 slow solo, 1 slow couple, 1 fast solo, 1 fast couple) and two all skates. The judges will choose the winners. &nbsp;</p>

<p>More details will be given during the competition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>May the best dancers be victorious!</p>

<p>The photo booth is closed during competitions and performances you might want to come a bit early, since there could be a bit of a cue.</p>
